# Step 2.2

1. The size of this relationship is 0.37757 which means the DNMs are growing
at this rate based on the maternal age. This does match my plot. 
2. The relationship is significant because the p value is 2e-16 which means that
2e-16 is the chance that this difference is caused by random chance.

# Step 2.6

1. The size of this relationship is 39.23485 which means the average DNM count
coming from the father is higher than DMS coming from the mothers. This does match my plot.     
2. The relationship is significant because the p value is 2e-16 which means that
2e-16 is the chance that this difference is caused by random chance.

# Step 3.1
I chose the 2024-01-23 dataset. Specifically the english_education.csv.
Hypothesis: Population with be positively correlated with education score.

This linear regression model does not fit the data well. The R-squared value is
0.01219.
