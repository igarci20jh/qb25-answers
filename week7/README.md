## Exercise 1
# Examine the PCA plot. Does everything look okay (We wouldn’t ask if it did)?
No the LFC.FE and FE sample clusters overlap.

# What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
The samples may have been switched because the other clusters are so tight together.

# What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
Midgut tissue

## Exercise 3
Hexose transmembrane transport, monosaccharide transmembrane transport, and carbohydrate transport make sense as the samples are from the gut which is involved in digestion and absorption.
The other categories including macromolecule metabolic process also make sense for the same reason.
